# Rule-Engine-Using-Scala
Rule-Based Discount Engine This Scala project implements a rule-based engine for calculating discounts on retail orders. It reads transaction data from a CSV file, applies various discount rules based on product expiry, product type, special dates, quantity purchased, payment method, and channel used, and then calculates the final price for each order. The project adheres to functional programming principles, using only val bindings, immutable data structures, and pure functions.

Features Expiry Date Discount: Calculates a discount based on the number of days remaining for a product to expire. Cheese and Wine Discount: Provides discounts for cheese and wine products. March Special Date Discount: Applies a special discount for products sold on the 23rd of March. Quantity Discount: Offers discounts based on the quantity of a product purchased. Visa Card Discount: Provides a minor discount for orders paid using Visa cards. App Usage Discount: Encourages app usage by offering discounts for orders made through the app. Usage Input: Place your transaction data CSV file (TRX1000.csv) in the src/main/resources/ directory. Run: Execute the Main class to process the data and calculate discounts. Output: The program will log its events in main.log and save the discounted orders in enginefinal.csv. Database: Results are also inserted into an Oracle database table named orders.

Notes Make sure to set up the Oracle database connection URL, username, and password in the Main class. Ensure that the CSV file is correctly formatted with columns for timestamp, product name, expiry date, quantity, unit price, channel, and payment method.
